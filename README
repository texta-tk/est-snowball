Here's Snowball for Estonian version 1.3.

In order to test it:

put words you want to test into the file 'voc.txt' one word per line

run ' ./testest.sh'

the result will appear in file 'TEMP-txt'.

This repository contains the source code for the snowball compiler and has been edited for Estonian language by Linda Freienthal from Estonian text analytics enterprise Texta. The code's original git version is here: https://github.com/snowballstem/snowball/tree/e103b5c257383ee94a96e7fc58cab3c567bf079b.

In file 'Estonian Snowball 1.3.odt' you'll find the algorithm written out. 

In file 'SB1.3_results.odt' you can browse some good and poor examples of the results of this algorithm.
